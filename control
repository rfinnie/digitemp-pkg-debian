Description: read temperature sensors in a 1-Wire net
 Digitemp is a program that reads data coming from a 1-Wire network using
 a passive adapter (DS9097) or the newer active adapter (DS9097U), 
 connected to a serial port. It also supports reading from USB adaptors 
 like the DS2490. Basically it reads temperature sensors, but others 
 are supported, like a humidity sensor.
 .
 Digitemp also supports branched networks using DS2409 couplers.
