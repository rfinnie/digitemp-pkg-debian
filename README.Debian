digitemp for Debian
-------------------

In order to use this software as a normal user, you have to add the
desired users to the group dialout, which grants that user access
to the serial ports.

This debian release includes three executables from upstream: 
digitemp_DS9097, digitemp_DS9097U and digitemp_DS2490 in order 
to support all adapters: passive serial, active serial (DS9097U)
and USB (DS2490). It does not install any executable named digitemp
as it used in older upstream versions.
